Chatterbox client
==============

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. I worked on this with one other person. During the project we built a chat client, making use of the parse API. 

## Structure:

The repository consists of

- jQuery app
- test Specs files.

#### Chatterbox app - Jquery version 

The app allows the user to chose rooms and fetch/post messages to and from a parse based API backend.

## Install:

The project relies on bower for managing external libraries and dependencies, so be sure to first:

`bower install`

to run it, simply open `./client/index.html` with your browser.

### SpecRunner - mocha

The specrunner contains tests for the client

### Testing

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run open the spec runner file with chrome.

```
SpecRunner.html
```
